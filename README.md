# Extracting GPS data from images

This script extracts GPS coordinates from EXIF data embedded in image files, and
writes it into a CSV file

## Usage

By default, the current directory will be searched recursively for JPEG images

```
ruby extract.rb
```

### Verbose logging

Enabling verbose mode will print more debugging information to the terminal.
By default, only errors and warnings will be printed.

```
ruby extract.rb --verbose
```

### Strict extraction mode

Enabling strict mode will raise errors if invalid JPEG files or malformed EXIF
data are encountered while processing images. This behaviour is disabled by
default.

```
ruby extract.rb --strict
```

### Search specific directory

Optionally you may specify a different directory to search

```
ruby extract.rb /home/jack/photos/vacation
```

### Output data type

By default, the output data will be a CSV file in the searched directory. It is
possible to change this and instead write the data to an HTML file.

```
ruby extract.rb --html
```
